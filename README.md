        that every one will go to this restarent.Beautiful Mandi biriyani experience. Multi-cuisine restaurant,
        but best for Arabian cuisine. Mandi biriyani is a must try for anytime visiting here. The Arabian mixed
        mandi beats them all as you get a variety of non-veg items with the biriyani. Half Mandi should be sufficient
        for 3 people and the full, for easily 6-7 people. The ambience was brilliant, staff are well mannered and it
        was a very different experience altogether in comparison to any other regular restaurant.
